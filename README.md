Aspen is a governance token
At our core the intention is to give the Aspen token holder a say in the governance of the platforms that they use.
So what we need to discuss is how the token will be distributed initially and subsequently. Our intention is that the Aspen Token will be distributed for staking in the Hypersphere Exchange as an additional reward on-top of the trading fee that is dispersed to liquidity providers.
Aspen will be dispensed according to the proportion of the total liquidity that is provided by each individual address. So let’s get into the pie chart of how Aspen Token is distributed among the team and general public.

Max Token Supply: 45,000,000
The max supply of Aspen Token is 45,000,000 with a break down of 30,000,000 available via staking, 5,000,000 within the Aspen Foundation and 10,000,000 reserved for the Aspen team.
The important part here is to understand how Aspen is dispensed over time as this is how we want to guarantee the appreciation of the token for the holders.
For the Aspen team the 10,000,000 will be dispersed at a rate of 2,000,000 a year for 5 years post release of our token. Our hope is to prevent any dumping of token on the market by team members.
The 5,000,000 tokens within the Aspen Foundation which will be used to fund promotional activities, auditing activities and funding of development projects within the ecosystem will be available for immediate use by Aspen. We will open up an application and review process that will be available for any community member to apply.

Aspen Token yearly dispensation
The 30,000,000 tokens that are available via staking will be distributing in the following manner; 3,000,000 per year which works out to 8,219 tokens per day distributed. Aspen token distribution will halve every 3 years. By year 7–10 after release of our protocol only 750,000 tokens per year would be released.
In a 32 year period 23,743,750 tokens will be issued via pool staking. When adding the 15,000,000 that is minted for the team and foundation that makes a total of 38,743,750 tokens representing 86% of the total supply. Over the next 32 years the total issued tokens would equal 56,030 representing 0.12% of the total supply. Our intention is that Aspen will have a tangible potential as a vehicle of value creation over years.

How Aspen will be dispensed
We believe our distribution method allows for greater autonomy of our community and transparency in the tokenomics of our protocol. Slowly restricting the volume of Aspen distribution allows the earlier adopters of our protocol not only to benefit the most (financially) but have the largest say as a voting block in terms of governance of the protocol over time.
As we draw closer to the release of our first decentralized application, dCOLLECT, we want to keep prospective users in the loop regarding our projects. In the coming weeks we will be writing more about how our applications work and how they come to form a strong stack of De-Fi apps that enable your financial freedom.
